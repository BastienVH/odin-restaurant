# Odin-restaurant
My implementation for the [restaurant page](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-restaurant-page) exercise for The Odin Project.

Project status: **FINISHED**.

- Search when getting stuck! I spent way too much time trying to get an background image to display full width/height, while [CSS-Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/perfect-full-page-background-image/) was only one Google search away...
